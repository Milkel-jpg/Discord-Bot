# Discord-Bot
I created this bot intially to play around with Discord.py and to better understand Python in a more interesting way, this has been a part time project since 2024 and has since become something that I'm quite proud of.

This bot was written by solely me, I did not use AI in any part of the creation process for this bot and I do not intend to in the future.

# What does this bot do?
This bot currently:
- Tracks user messages and stores/pulls them from a local json database.
- Manages API calls.
- Searches, downloads and plays music from YouTube upon user request.

# What have I learnt from this project?
I've learnt a great deal about Python, and creating bots for Discord. I'd say the important things are:
- Basics about APIs.
- Importing libraries.
- Handle user input and responding with the expected output.
- Error handling in Python.

# Is this project complete?
Nope, the project is far from completion, it's a slow burner but I intend on adding more features such as:
- Cleaner and more readable code.
- Automated content moderation & user punishment.
- Fixing present issues, mainly with the YouTube player part of the bot.
- And more, if I can think of anything.
