# Discord-Bot
I created this bot to be included in a discord server I spoke frequently in, this bot stores messages in json which is intentional since it's such a small scale project data persistence can remain temporary and stored locally. This project has been on-going off and on since 2024 and it's gone under many iterations.

# TL;DR 
I created this bot to experiment with Discord.py, Python async and API integrations. It tracks messages, stores them locally based off users reactions and also includes media-playback via yt-dlp (no longer in project code right now).

# What does this bot do?
This bot currently:
- Tracks user messages and stores/pulls them from a local json database.
- Manages API calls.
- Searches, downloads and plays music from YouTube upon user request.

# What have I learnt from this project?
I've learnt a great deal about Python, and creating bots for Discord. I'd say the important things are:
- Basics about APIs.
- Importing libraries.
- Handle user input and responding with the expected output.
- Error handling in Python.

# Is this project complete?
Nope, the project is far from completion, it's a slow burner but I intend on adding more features such as:
- Cleaner and more readable code.
- Automated content moderation & user punishment.
- Fixing present issues, mainly with the YouTube player part of the bot.
- And more, if I can think of anything.
